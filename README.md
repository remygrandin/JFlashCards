The structure and data is based on wikipedia articles on [Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) & [Katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana). It itegrate all in use gojūon & yōon with (han)dakuten variants.

I recommend printing it on hard paper to allow them to not be sturndy enough and not see through in bright light.

Please note that **it may contain error**. If you find any, please kindly open an issue here.

I'm in no way a japaneese instructor, only a french guy trying to learn :-)
